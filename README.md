## Live coding demo for Brave Initiatives' Brave Bash
### View the demo at http://bravebash.com/
*(it scrolls because we will be displaying it on monitors throughout the room)

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repo 
2. `cd` into the repo
3. Open your Terminal
4. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`

## Teaching HTML/CSS
### Objective:
- Each person should build a small HTML section for their Bravest Moment
- Students should learn how to modify HTML, add styles using CSS, add an image, and modify text

### How to modify the code
- In `index.html`, find the section that looks like this: `<section class='container' id='rosa-parks'>`
- Each `section` element is an example of what the end result could look like
- Each new `section` you add should have its own unique `id` so that the student can easily modify the CSS
- Help your student add text, an image, and modify the CSS
- You may *add* HTML elements but I suggest you *don't remove* elements within the `section`
- Add your CSS to `styles_edit_me.css` and *do not edit* `styles_do_not_edit.css`
